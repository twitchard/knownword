Known Word is the little sister of my other Alexa Skill, "Secret Word".
In that skill:
1. Alexa determines a five letter secret word.
2. You guess five-letter words.
3. After each guess, Alexa tells you the number of words that your guess
   has in common with the secret word.
4. You try and deduce the secret word from this information, but it's
   too hard and you eventually give up.

Known word reverses this. In this skill:
1. You determine a five letter word.
2. Alexa guesses five-letter words.
3. After each guess, you tell Alexa the number of letters that your
   word has in common with her guess.
4. Alexa guesses it correctly, because unlike you, she is not an idiot
